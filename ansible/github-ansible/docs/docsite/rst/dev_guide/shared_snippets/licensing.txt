.. note::
   **LICENSING REQUIREMENTS**  Ansible enforces the following licensing requirements:

   * Utilities (files in ``lib/ansible/module_utils/``) may have one of two licenses:
      * A ``module_util`` used **only** for a specific vendor's hardware, provider, or service may be licensed under GPLv3+.
      * All other ``module_utils`` must be licensed under BSD, so GPL-licensed third-party and Galaxy modules can use them.
      * If there's doubt about the appropriate license for a ``module_util``, the Ansible Core Team will decide during an Ansible Core Community Meeting.
   * All other files shipped with Ansible, including all modules, must be licensed under the GPL license (GPLv3 or later).
